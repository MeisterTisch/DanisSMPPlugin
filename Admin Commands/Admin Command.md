Command for **adding** and **removing** players as an admin.
An admin is not necessarily for the plugin to work, but is very helpful to execute all admin relevant commands ingame.
Adding the ever first admin is possible through the conole or adding an UUID in the [[admins.yml]]. Preferable is the console.
The admin role is visually not displayed ingame. 

_Admins will be saved in [[admins.yml]]_.
