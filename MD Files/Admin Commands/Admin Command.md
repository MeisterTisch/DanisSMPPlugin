# Admin Command

Command for **adding** and **removing** players as an admin.
An admin is not necessarily for the plugin to work, but is very helpful to execute all admin relevant commands ingame.
Adding the ever first admin is possible through the console or adding a UUID in the admins.yml. Preferable is the console.
The admin role is visually not displayed ingame. 

_Admins will be saved in admins.yml_.
